Team User story: As a flight operations manager, Sarah wants to search for flights by their flight number so that she can quickly access detailed flight information, including status updates, departure and arrival times, and any changes, to stay on top of her daily operations. She runs the program and searches by flight number to find her results.

Niala’s User Story: Niala, an airport operations supervisor, needs to search for the list of flights arriving at a specific airport so that she can track incoming flights and ensure proper coordination for gate assignments and passenger flow. She runs the program and inputs the airport iata code to see all incoming flights for the day.

Anthony’s User Story: Anthony, a ground operations coordinator, wants to search for the list of flights departing from a specific airport so that he can monitor outgoing flights, ensure timely departures, and manage logistical operations such as baggage handling. He runs the program and inputs the airport iata code to view the list of flights leaving the airport.

Abigail’s User Story: Sill wants to be able to search for flights by airline code so that they can view all flights operated by a specific airline, making it easier for her to monitor the airline’s flight activity and handle customer queries more effectively. They run the program and enter the airline iata code to pull up the list of flights for that airline.

Andrew’s User Story: Andrew, a data analyst at an airport, wants to search for flights that have already landed at a specific airport so that he can analyze post-arrival data, such as on-time performance and passenger disembarkation times.
