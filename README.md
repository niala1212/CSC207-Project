Stories:

- Team User story: As a plane enthusiast and photographer, Sean (random name) needs to find the best times and places to see his favorite plane models. He runs the flight tracker program and finds the nearest airport to determine the kinds of flights that will be coming in later that day. He is shown a list of the airlines and flights alongside the plane's flight information (departure, landing, airport, etc.).  
- Sean’s friend is flying in to visit, the flight was supposed to land already but there was a delay. Sean uses the program to find the flight and determine its current status and when it is expected to land. [Daniel’s user story]  
- Jelly’s brother is visiting and they want to see where their brother’s flight currently is on the map. They enter the flight number and see the flight icon over the plane’s location. [Sill’s User Story]  
- Niala is extremely interested in all of the flights that are going to NYC. She searches up the JFK airport and is able to see all of the departures and arrivals. [Niala’s user story]  
- Johnny is planning a vacation and wants to decide which airport to fly out from. He enters the names of two airports separately to see each one’s upcoming departures and checks for delays or cancellations. After reviewing the information, he chooses the airport that best fits his travel plans. [Anthony’s user story]  
- Andrew wants to conduct a research project analyzing tourism trends around the world. To do that, he wants all public flight information, which could give him concrete numbers to conduct further analysis/research on. [Andrew’s user story]
