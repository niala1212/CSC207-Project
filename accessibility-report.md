1. Principles of Universal Design
    - Equitable Use: The program displays information based on the inputted value and as such, does not segregate against users in any way. This also means that the program is the same for all users, regardless of any diverse ability.
    - Flexibility in Use: Our program has 6 different functionalities, allowing for a diverse method of use. Furthermore, the buttons to choose which function to use on the app is large enough such that a great amount of precision and accuracy is unneeded.
    - Simple and Intuitive Use: The buttons for the different methods are clearly labeled with what they do. Also, the search buttons in the separate views all have a placeholder text, explaining what is expected to be inputted as well as an example. This makes the design easy to use and understand, regardless of user knowledge.
    - Perceptible Information: The design ensures high contrast between text and background making it easy to read the flight information. However, the information is only displayed visually, and we could implement a text to speech feature to help with users with sensory disabilities, such as blindness.
    - Tolerance for Error: The search bars all have placeholder texts which help minimizes any errors or hazards. In the event that an invalid code is inputted, an error message is displayed, showing the reason why the input was invalid. We also made sure to consider all the cases when an invalid code could be inputted, such as inputting nothing.
    - Low Physical Effort: Since this program is an online product, this principle does not relate to our product that much. However, since it is an app, this ensures that it minimizes any physical effort and allows for the user to maintain a neutral body position.
    - Size and Space for Approach and Use: Once again, since our product is an app, this principle does not relate to our product that much. Much of the requirements for this principle such as accommodating variations in hand and grip size, or providing adequate space for assistive devices is dependent on the user itself. Our program is not a tangible product.
   
2. Our target audience for this product are travelers and commuters, friends and family of these travelers, and an airline crew or staff. The travellers and commuters can use this program to see if any of their flights are being delayed or not. Furthermore, they can also make travel arrangements based on any of the flight information. The friends and family of the commuters can use this to check when they are landing and plan accordingly. Similarly to the travellers, the airline staff can use this product to check for any delays that could be happening with their aircraft.

3. Some groups that may not be able to take advantage are people without access to internet or people with sensory limitations, such as blindness. Users without access to the internet would not be able to gain the data from the api and the product will not be able to retrieve any flight data. Additionally, since our product follows a social model, it is not well-equipped for users with blindness or any disabilities in their hands. Our information is only displayed visually and it requires a keyboard input from the user to actually search anything.
